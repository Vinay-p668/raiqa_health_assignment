# RAIQA Health Assignment

This is my submission for the RAIQA Health Assignment. It's a simple React app with a counter and a list of numbers.  The app has a classic look with a clean design, and it meets all the requirements like sorting, local storage, and highlighting numbers.

## Features
- **Counter**: You can increase or decrease a number (can't go below 0).
- **Add to List**: Add the counter number to a list (only if it's greater than 0). It won't add duplicates.
- **List**: Shows all added numbers, saved in local storage so they stay after refreshing the page.
- **Sort**: Toggle between ascending and descending order.
- **Reset**: Clear the list and local storage.
- **Highlighting**: The highest number is green, the lowest is red, and if they're the same, it's yellow.
- **Styling**: Used custom CSS with a classic look .
